# C-RedBlackTree
A red black tree written in C, algorithms are ported from Sedgewick and Wayne: Algs4

`Key` and `Value` types are defined in RedBlackTree.h, these can be changed - though one should be mindful about comparisons between these data types. Furthermore, if one of the two types is not primary you must copy the data explicitly. The `applyKeyVal` function is called from tree node creation to streamline this.
